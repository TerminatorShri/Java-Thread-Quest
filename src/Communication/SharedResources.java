         * - So, only ONE thread (the consumer) is waiting ‚Äî no need to wake up others.
         *
         * üö® If there were MULTIPLE consumers (or producers), use `notifyAll()` instead:
         *     notifyAll(); // Wakes up ALL threads waiting on this monitor object.
         *     - Safer in scenarios with multiple waiting threads.
         *     - Prevents thread starvation or missed signals.
